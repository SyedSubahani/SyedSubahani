## üëã Hey, I'm Subahani !
I'm a dedicated and passionate ML and Gen AI Engineer with expertise in models like GPT, Open-Source LLMs, and GANs. I specialize in NLP using NLTK, spaCy, and Transformers. My experience extends to developing ML models with TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn. 

I have extensive experience in ASP.NET, building scalable web applications, and robust back-end services. Proficient in C#, I integrate complex business logic and design RESTful APIs for seamless communication. Skilled in MSBI tools, I handle ETL processes with SSIS and generate reports with SSRS. Additionally, I'm adept at SQL Server, including complex queries and database optimization. I enjoy creating innovative solutions and continuously expanding my skill set. 

Feel free to explore my repositories and contributions. I'm always eager to collaborate on exciting Machine Learning and Generative AI projects and discuss innovative ideas!
