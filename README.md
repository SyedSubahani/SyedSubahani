## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Syed Subahani !
I'm a dedicated ML and Gen AI Engineer with expertise in models like GPT, Open-Source LLMs, and GANs. I specialize in NLP using NLTK, spaCy, and Transformers. My experience extends to developing ML models with TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn. 

I have extensive experience in ASP.NET, building scalable web applications, and robust back-end services. Proficient in C#, I integrate complex business logic and design RESTful APIs for seamless communication. Skilled in MSBI tools, I handle ETL processes with SSIS and generate reports with SSRS. Additionally, I'm adept at SQL Server, including complex queries and database optimization. I enjoy creating innovative solutions and continuously expanding my skill set.
